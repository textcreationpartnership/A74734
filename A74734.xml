            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A CHARACTER OF THE Oxford Libeller.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>E is a Gentleman grown louſie, not in the Noble way of Arms, but with ſinging of Ballads: Time was, when he wore himſelf out at Elbows with fine cloathes to bee cried up by the Women, and ſtiled a Wit; When that would not doe, he turned Alchymiſt, and made projection of his Land, to give a tincture to his brain. This wrought a little; but the chiefe of his Trophies is due to the Sword of his enemy: which, had it ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Cedar, had left him a very Shrub in the Muſes Mount, hardly a Fagot of bruſh wood, though now he undertakes to hedge in victories, as the Sages of <hi>Gotham</hi> did the Cuckow.</p>
            <p>The main thing that confirmes him in his errour
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:159421:3"/>is, that the great Ladies are all for the Cavaliers, to whoſe charmes they at <hi>Oxford</hi> either give ſuch an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance, as the Devill doth to Magicians, or keep them like Coy-ducks, or Pigeons of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> to ſend hither with letters, as they uſed to doe Footmen to the Porters lodge.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>Legiſlative</hi> hee takes to bee a Fiddle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring, and is alwayes ſcraping upon it, though it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to his brother <hi>Waller</hi> (a man, as the Muſes can teſtifie, ſomething ſharper ſighted) after a whole years ſtudy upon the poynt, to be a ſadder object, and rather reſembling an halter.</p>
            <p>He makes no uſe of religious Epithites, except it be to pin them, as Boyes doe Fox-tailes, upon their backes, whom hee would laugh at. Hee dares ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach no neerer to the ſanctity of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayer book, then <hi>Hopkins</hi> and <hi>Sternhold:</hi> but out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does the Devill at Scripture, which hee never brings out, but as the Jewes did Chriſt, to ſcorn and ſpit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; hee would not bee hired to uſe the Legend, Talmud, or Alcaron ſo, becauſe they reſemble <hi>Ovids Metamorphoſis.</hi> Hee Chriſtens Beaſts and Men whom hee imagines little better, with Scripture names, to make them iridiculous, whileſt hee gives Poeticall ones to his Miſtreſſes, not to be pronounced without adoration. And as he uſes the beſt Book, becauſe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles not his ſtudies, ſo he doth the beſt men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they reſemble not his companions.</p>
            <p>If a man have zeale, like a right Bull-dogge, he flies ſtraight at his Noſe, the old Paris-garden com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon place, by which you may diſcover the breeding of his wit, and by a late ſnuffle hee hath got in his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:159421:3"/>own, whoſe tender griſtle hee laps up in dirty ragges, raked out of the dunghill of ruined ſtages, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as very a tyrant at it, as Sir <hi>Iohn Falſeſtolf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is ſo ſad at the abortion of Plots, that hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies nothing ſo much as a good Mid-wife, a skill he intends to practiſe againſt Sir <hi>Edward Hides</hi> belly bee brought to bed of <hi>Spinola's</hi> Whale. In the mean time, becauſe <hi>Briſtow</hi>'s grown a dotard, hee is contented to be Nurſe unto the ſecond infancie of his brain; but ſo dry a one, that hee is fain to borrow <hi>Culpeppers</hi> ſucking-bottle, which, whileſt the Janiſaries hold the town of <hi>Briſtow,</hi> is ſure never to want milk.</p>
            <p>I had almoſt overſeen ſhady <hi>Cottington,</hi> who was pitched in <hi>Spain,</hi> horn'd in <hi>England,</hi> and moves e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince like <hi>Fauxe's</hi> dark Lanthorne: this fellow is a <hi>Burrachio</hi> full of Spaniſh ſnuffs, riſen like the ſpirit of Sack from the Cellar to the Councell-table.</p>
            <p>He would take it in foule ſcorne (though this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſant Knights errantry never knew other carreer, then that which lies between a priſon and an Alehouſe) that you ſhould celebrate him by the name of <hi>Don Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xot,</hi> or ſay, he hath a windmill in his head; no, it is a watermill, open but the ſluce of a Hogſhead, and you ſet <hi>Pericranium</hi> on worke, like the great wheele, till his fiſts, the milſtones, grind you the bottles (like Miſcelline) to gather with the next noddle. Hee is a terrible State-engine, and had he lived in <hi>Machiavils</hi> time, would have ſet his head where his heels ſtood: he gives his Oracles, like <hi>Sibylla,</hi> flaming: hee is the politicke <hi>Barnaval;</hi> the <hi>Bacchanalia</hi> are to him but an <hi>Aſh-wedneſday.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord <hi>George</hi> helped our Libeller with two or
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:159421:4"/>three of his jeſts; and is abſolutely, in his opinion (and his owne) the hopeſulleſt young Stateſ-man, whileſt his necke is able to ſupport the weight of his brain, in <hi>Europe,</hi> though his <hi>Spaniſh</hi> gravitie be ſomething miſcompoſed by his late Treatie with <hi>Browne;</hi> ſince which time, hee goes to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell board like a <hi>Lictor,</hi> with a faggot in his face: and it is feared, becauſe the Fates are women, that hee will be leſſe of their counſell for this deformity. Hee looks with fervent eyes upon the Lievtnant of the <hi>Hierarchie,</hi> Doctor <hi>Steward,</hi> whoſe foot hee hopes, will ſtand its ground better then his Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s head: indeed the foot is a fine foot, and hath coſt ſomething in Ribbon, to hang it for a doctrine &amp; uſe in the eye of the Ladies, for he never hangs any in their eares. Hee would faine know for how long my Lord <hi>Hoptons</hi> ſoul hath taken a leaſe of his body: perhaps for ſome ſeven yeeres longer then his honour. Hee is very modeſt; for that's all he ſaith of his <hi>Oxford</hi> Champions. Where's <hi>Goring?</hi> hath that wilde colt forgot the trick of treſpaſſing upon the Commons? is the <hi>Legiſlative</hi> hedge too ſtrong for him? hath he not been often enough ſicke of the ſtaggers, to forget the Pinner of <hi>Wakefield?</hi> Where's little <hi>Porter,</hi> that came hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a ſtratagem, to provide himſelf of an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and cary away the Town-gates with him, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving (for your ſervice, if you pleaſe to advance, Gentlemen) the city as penetrable, as he found his Miſtreſſe? Where's <hi>Gerrat<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:159421:4"/>For ſhame, Poet, lend him <hi>Pegaſus;</hi> ſhall one of your chief Commanders ride out of the world up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>Gooſe?</hi> And where's my Lord of <hi>Loughborow?</hi> cannot <hi>Aulicus,</hi> though you confeſſe him to be a Witch, conjure up his ſpirits? are they all redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to their ſubterranean manſion? or ſit with their browne bills, cawing like Dawes out of the holes of old walls? This is a ſad Chronacek, Poet, to be written upon thread-bare breeches. I pray you, how long is it ſince you ſaw a pair of new Boots? It was time to go to the Market at <hi>Uxbridge:</hi> there is no more hope of my Lord of <hi>Norwitches</hi> frippery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve mee, that deſigne of his, to bring all the Nuns linnen and petticoats into Sir <hi>Balthazar Gerbiers monte di pieta,</hi> is a dangerous one; for what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of you, if the Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> turn <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite</hi> for want of a ſmock? Well, remember mee to <hi>Mercurius Aulicus,</hi> hee muſt raiſe the next ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and pay it too. I will make bold to borrow one of your diddles to lap a token of my love to him in.</p>
